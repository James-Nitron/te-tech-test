## How to run the application

Upon downloading/cloning the application, please open up the folder within your IDE of choice. And then use the following command/s **npm** or **yarn** start.

Once the application has started it will ask you to provide two numbers. The first number is how big you would like the array. An example of 7 would look like this [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ].
The second number is used to divide the above array into equally sized arrays. For example 4, this would provide the following output [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],[6]]

An error will cause the application to exit in which case it will need to be re-run manually using the stated commands.
