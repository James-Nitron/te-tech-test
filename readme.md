## How to run the application


### npm or yarn start

Once the application has started it will ask you to provide two numbers. The first number is how big you would like the array. An example of 7 would look like this [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ].
The second number is used to divide the above array into equally sized arrays. For example 4, this would provide the following output [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],[6]]
